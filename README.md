Database Design
The design of the database is completely upon you. Design is according to your needs but design it wisely. Make sure you can defend yourself if you were asked any question about the design issues of your database.

Web Page Design
Design of the web pages will not carry any mark for the time being. You can use simple black and white design and use any input controls according to your need. But be reasonable while choosing input controls for your pages. For example you should not use a textbox or a checkbox for gender input.
